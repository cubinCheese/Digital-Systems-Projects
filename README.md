## üìÅ Project Overview

### Robertson's Multiplier Lab Project
‚û§ Implements Robertson's algorithm for binary multiplication. This project explores sequential logic, arithmetic circuits, and state machines by building a hardware multiplier that processes bitwise operations step by step.

### Alarm Clock Lab Project
‚û§ Designs a digital alarm clock using counters, comparators, and control logic. Key concepts include timekeeping, alarm setting, output display, and the use of finite state machines for modular design.

### Traffic Lights Lab Project
‚û§ Simulates a traffic light controller for an intersection. The design utilizes state machines to control light sequences and timing, highlighting real-world applications of sequential logic.

### Transmitter - Error Correction Lab Project
‚û§ Implements a data transmitter with error correction, likely using encoding schemes such as Hamming or parity bits. This project introduces error detection and correction for reliable digital communication.

### Receiver - Error Correction Lab Project
‚û§ Complements the transmitter by decoding and correcting received data. The receiver validates and corrects errors, reinforcing practical use of error correction algorithms in hardware.
